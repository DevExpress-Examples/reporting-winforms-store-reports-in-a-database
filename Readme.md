# Reporting for WinForms - How to Store Reports in a Database


This example shows how to save (load) a report definition to (from) a database. The application saves reports using the [XtraReport.SaveLayout](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReport.SaveLayout.overloads) method to the `ReportsDB.mdb` Microsoft Access database. The [XtraReport.LoadLayout](https://docs.devexpress.com/XtraReports/DevExpress.XtraReports.UI.XtraReport.LoadLayout(System.IO.Stream)) method loads a report from the database.
